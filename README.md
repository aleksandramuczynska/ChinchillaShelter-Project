# ChinchillaShelterProject

This app is a simple page inspired by pastel style.
My ChinchillaShelter Project features chinchillas and their specific traits, as well as facts about their lifestyles. Since chinchillas aren't as well-known as standard pets, it also encourages people to get to know more about them or see them in a new light, making the adoption more attractive.

## Technology

The project was generated with [Angular CLI] version 15.1.1.

The language is TypeScript

ChinchillaShelter Project was styled with Sass.

## What I've learned

I'm still a constantly learning enthusiast, but it's been a dream of mine to continue learning and perfecting my front-end skills. This project definitely made me come closer to this goal and that's what I'm thankful for. I wish to constantly create new things that'll allow me to reach new heights and inspire both me and people.
